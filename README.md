# House Price Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The goal is to provide an accurate estimate of house prices, which can be useful for both sellers and buyers in the real estate market.

The project focuses on:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling).
- Model training using various regression algorithms.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on houses such as:
- **Square footage**
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Number of bathrooms**
- **Year built**
- **Lot size**
- **Location**

The target variable is the **house price**. You can find the dataset [here](#) or use any publicly available housing datasets such as from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Selection**: Algorithms used include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared are used to assess the model's accuracy.
